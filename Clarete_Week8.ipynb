Sir\\nWilliam Jones, a critic of no mean authority,\\nsays: \\u201cI am.of opinion that the Bible contains\\nmore true sensibility, more exquisite beauty,\\nmore pure morality, more impartial history,\\nand finer strains of poetry and eloquence than\\ncan be collected from all other books, in what\\never age or language they may be written.\\u201d\\nIt is the testimony of John Milton, the immor\\ntal bard who came into the immediate presence\\nof God, as never did any other uninspired poet,\\nthat \\u201cthere are no songs comparable to the\\nsongs of Zion, no orations equal to those of the\\nprophets, and no politics like those which the\\nScriptures teach.\\u201d\\nMost of our writers who have undertaken\\na definition of poetry, have recognized the dif\\nficulty o fthe task.

The Greeks employ its classical equiva\\nlent to designate the artistic productions of\\nthe imagination expressed in language. We\\nknow well that poetry is not necessarily asso\\nciated with verse or rhyme. It often finds\\nsuperb expression in prose. The Book of Ruth\\nis eminently poetic in substance, although in\\nform it is prose. Many parts of the Book of\\nJob and of the prophetical writings are also\\ndistinctly poetical;- It would be easy to name\\nwriters of recent and comparatively recent\\ntimes, such as Jeremy Taylor, Hooker, Burke,\\nRuskin, Hawthorne, Emerson, and especially\\nLincoln, and many whose sentences, though in\\nthe form of prose, are richly imaginative and\\nare truly poetical. Whole paragraphs spoken\\nby Lincoln in his exalted moments have been\\nin exact poetic forms. In general, however,\\npoetry tends to express itself in certain rules\\nof metre, and also to assume rhythmical lan\\nguage. The music of the metre heightens the\\nemotions and tends by mysterious but uni\\nversal laws to seek expression in measured\\nforms.\\nWhatever may be our definition of poetry,\\nwe shall find that it lias some of its noblest\\nillustrations in the Word of God.

Prob\\nably the very earliest attempts to give rhyth\\nmical expression to human thoughts assumed\\nthe form of pastoral poetry. Shepherds rep\\nresented a large portion of the population in\\nprimitive times, and their pastoral songs ami\\nmetres would naturally take their form from\\ntheir daily pursuits and evironments. As a\\ndistinct branch of poetic art, pastoral poetry\\nwas not cultivated until a comparatively late\\nday; but it must be affirmed that the Hebrew\\nPatriarchs, prophets, and poets give us some\\nof the most noticeable examples of this style of\\npoetic composition to be found in any lan\\nguage. The story of Ruth is idyllic in\\noften pastoral in form, and charming in spirit ;\\nand the Twenty-third Psalm is as peerless in\\nits pastoral charm as it is tender in its relig\\nious associations.

Mr. Good Jew, Mr. Good\\nSlugger, or Mr. Good or Bad Any\\nman. A Forum Writer.\\nPOETRY. I heard a very instruc\\ntive and interesting.talk by Prof. Mc\\nClintock at the Lawndaje Civic Cen\\nter on \\\"The Value of Popular\\nPoetry.\\\" \\\"The greatest art of the\\npoet,\\\" said the learned professor, \\\"is\\nto study popular taste and give them\\nwhat they want\\\"\\nIt is unfortunate that the classes\\nunderstand so well the psychology of\\nthe masses and are therefore able to\\nplay upon their emotion as a musi\\ncian plays upon a harp. They feed\\nthem with poetry which appeals to\\nthe most ingrained prejudices of\\nman.\\nPoetry is not creative at best That\\nis, it does not .teach nor discover\\noriginal ideas; it either tends to ap\\npeal to the emotions and prejudices\\nof the race, or it revolves round some\\nprogressive idea as a sattelite and\\nhelps to inspire humanitarians to\\nfight until they have reached their\\ngoal.\\nPopular poetry is not poetry which\\nappeals wholly to the primitive feel\\nings of man, as that appeals to all\\nsections of mankind. The poetry the\\npeople are fed with is such as tend\\nto aid to perpetuate existing institu\\ntions.. The prpfessor said that the people\\nwere not intellectual but they are es\\nsentially sentimental. They like grue\\nsome and realistic tales. True, but\\nthe profesor failed to give the rea\\nsons for such popular taste.\\nTo the classes such taste appeals\\nto be low, popular and vulgar. For\\nit is easy for men who do not know\\nthe turmoils and strifes of life to\\nutter opinions on the low tastes and\\nsentimentality of the people. The\\nmasses find woe and sorrow at every\\nangle they turn. That is the reason\\nwhy woeful stories touch them. The\\nwealthy classes know of no other\\nwoes but that which nature imposes\\nupon them. The people suffer untold\\nmiseries which man imposes upon\\nman, hence their extreme sentimen\\ntality. The mental energies of the work\\ners exhausts itself in their daily\\ndrudgery and toil, therefore they do\\nnot think clearly upon their own in\\nterests. But a new and happier day\\nis dawning on the human horizon.\\nThe workers are demanding better\\nopportunities of self development and\\nfor self-expression. The spirit of as\\npiration animates them with the\\nsame zeal as it animated aristocratic\\nFaust, but the spirit of negation is\\nkeener in their case.\\nThe day will eventually dawn when,\\nthe titan of capitalism and oppres\\nsion will be conquered. Then \\\"The\\nAbysm will vomit forth the secrets\\nof nature\\\" even to the disinherited\\nmultitude. Sam Druck.\\nTEACHERS' HOURS. I have\\nheard so many confused statements\\nmade regarding the working hours of\\nteachers and their \\\"easy\\\" work that\\nI am constrained to give to those\\nwho \\\"desire truth and justice above\\nall things\\\" a real knowledge of the\\nactual facts.\\nAll teachers must be in their rooms\\nat 8:45 a. m. and 1 p. m. or be marked\\ntardy. This makes five and one-half\\nhours of compulsory work to begin\\nwith. The bookkeeping necessary\\nto -keeping records of attendance,\\npunctuality, grading and marking\\nexamination papers must be done out\\nof school hours.\\nIn every grade there is preparatory\\nwork to be done, so that every teach\\ner necessarily works from one to\\nthree hours more than the five and\\na half we started with. High school\\nteachers go on duty at least 15 min\\nutes before 9 a. m., have 30 minutes\\nfor lunch (and perhaps have to eat\\nthat in a study room in charge of\\nstudents.) High school closes at 3:30\\np. m., making six and three-quarter\\nhours' compulsory work, with an ad\\ndition to this of at least two hours'\\n-ini J3Kli:Lg's fNW\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[37m\u001b[39;49;00m\n",

Bunche, said\\nhere last week that the latest\\ncease-fire order in Palestine\\n\\u201cseems finally to have been ef\\nfective.\\u201d He was speaking of the\\ntemporary truce between the\\nIsraelis and the Lebanese.\\nHowever, he denied reports\\nthat he had pressed for abandon\\nment of the Bernadotte plan and\\nsubstitution of negotiations, either\\ndirect or through him. He said he\\nbelieved that negotiations for a\\npermanent peace were the next\\nstep but that he was not iQ a po\\ni, \\u2022 sition to \\u201cpress\\u201d for any settle\\nment.\\nHe did point out though that if\\nthe temporary truce is allowed\\nto drag on without decisive inter\\nnational action, respect for the\\ntruce would decline. He said that\\nP|p it has declined apparently with in\\ncreasing speed and that there has\\nbeen pretty general fighting going\\non in recent weeks, though the\\ntruce technically was still con\\nsidered operative.\\nPatronize Our Advertisers.\\n* \\u2014- -\\nSunday SdwoL\\n^Ccaad/l\\nSUNDAY, NOV. 21, 1948\\nTheme: Poetry in the Bible.\\nI Sam. 2:1-10; II Sam. 1:19-27;\\nPsalm 23, 24; 103; 136:1-9; Lam\\nentations 3:19-39; Habakkuk\\n3:17-19; Luke 1:46-55.\\nThere are all types of poetry\\nin the Bible. When we speak of\\npoetry we think of epic poetry,\\nlyric poetry, dramatic poetry\\nand didactic poetry, and all\\nthese are represented in the\\nBible. Epic poetry tells a story.\\nIt is in narrative form and treats\\nof action in the heroic manner.\\nThe familiar and oft quoted\\npoem by Lord Macauley, \\u201cHo\\nratius at the Bridge,\\u201d is an ex\\nample. The classic epics are the\\n\\u201cIliad\\u201d and the \\u201cOdyssey.\\u201d There\\nis, of course, nothing resembling\\nthese in the Bible, but the story\\nof Joseph is almost an epic poem\\naud there is an approach to epic\\nwriting in the passage dealing\\nwith Balak and Balaam in the\\nbook of Numbers. Perhaps\\nPsalm 68 and 78 have epic ele\\nments.\\nWhen we turn to Hebrew lyric\\npoetry we are faced with a wealth\\nof material unequalled in any\\nliterature. Lyric poetry ex\\npresses feelings rather than ac\\ntions. It has a musical lilt to it,\\nand is often sung. Robert Burns\\nwas a lyric poet, and his familiar\\npoems \\u201cO, my love is like a red,\\nred rose,\\u201d and \\u201cYe Banks and\\nBraes\\u201d are lyrics. Most of the\\npsalms are lyrics. In our day\\nthey have been reduced to met\\nrical form and are easily sung. ;\\nThe Book of Job, on the other\\nhand, is dramatic poetry. The\\npsalm given for our study is a j\\nfine piece of dramatic verse. The\\ncall and the answering refrain\\nare very vivid.\\nHebrew poetry, however, is\\nnot like English poetry. If you\\nread any of the great masters of\\npoetry in the English language\\u2014\\nShakespeare, Milton, Tennyson\\u2014\\nyou find there a sort of measured\\nrhythm. The lines have a cer\\ntain number of syllables, or feet.\\nSometimes the first two lines, or\\nthe first and third lines, rhyme,\\nand sometimes the measured\\nrhythm does not rhyme and we\\ncall such poetry Blank Verse,\\nsuch as we have in Milton\\u2019s\\nParadise Lost. We know Eng\\nlish poetry by its cadence, its\\nrhythm, its measured metre. But\\nthis is not true of Hebrew\\npoetry. Hebrew poetry is not\\nrecognized by the number of syl\\nlables, nor by rhyme. It is\\nusually characterized by what\\nwe call parallelism and also by\\naccent. Sometimes the second\\nline says the same thing as the\\nfirst line only in other words\\nand sometimes the second line is\\nthe very opposite of the first line.\\nSometimes three or four or six or\\neight lines are parallel and form\\nwhat we call a stanza. Take any\\npiece of Hebrew poetry and see\\nhow it is balanced.-*\\\" In our les\\nson we have parallel lines each\\nexpressing the same thought.\\n\\u201cWho shall ascend into the\\nhills of Jehovah? And who shall\\nstand in his holy place?\\u201d On the\\nother hand, we have parallel\\nlines which express opposite\\nthoughts: \\u201cJehovah knoweth the\\nway of the righteous But the\\nway of the ungodly shall perish.\\nPoetry is older than prose. The\\noldest literature in English is in\\nverse. This is true in every lan\\nguage! All peoples seem to begin\\ntheir literature in what are\\ncalled folk songs.

What is more,\\nthe most of us are so occupied and\\nconditioned that we are compelled to\\ntake a daily ride on a car and like\\nwise to read the aforesaid poetry\\nwhether we like it or not. We may\\nrefuse for a time to glance at it, but\\na chcerless, stupid cage in which an\\nunwilling, ill-natured public was carted from place\\nto place. Now it is fast becoming a veritable cir\\nculating library of poetry and art on wheels. The\\npopulace enters then in with the happy assurance\\nthat while there is small likelihood of its finding an\\nunoccupied seat, it is sure of meeting with many a\\nquaint and curious quatrain of poetic lore calculated\\nto make those who must cling to straps forget all\\ntheir woes and worries in contemplating the plea\\nsant food for thought so temptingly displayed on\\neverv hand.\\nWe've heard about those signs so plain that \\\"he who runs\\nmay read'':\\nBut when it comes to street-ear ads , why, there we do not\\nneed\\nTo run a bit, but idlv sit, al! active movements shunning,\\nAs by the mile we ride the while the car does all the\\nrunning.\\nWith what curious interest the street-car patron\\nhas watched the subtle but all-conquering advance\\nof poetry into the cold commercial world that\\nwas once deemed to be the undisputed realm of\\nplain prose.\\nTime was when poetry was est' erned to be too\\nfragile, too timid, too polite, to appear in mixed\\nassemblages. In those dear old delicate days it\\nwas honestly supposed that a full breath of real\\nbusiness atmosphere would prove almost fatal\\nto a tender triolet or a retiring rondo. But the\\ntimes change, and we are changed with them.\\nNowadays it is no unusual sight to see a sweet,\\nsentinental sonnet and a brisk, business-like sand\\nwich going hand in hand, as it were, about the busy\\nthoroughfares of our bustling cities.\\nTo illustrate the manner in which poetry is over\\ncoming prose, let us take, for example, a certain\\nwell-known brand of hair re newer which in the olden\\ndays when its name was first getting into placard\\ntype saw its virtues modestly hinted at in the\\nsimplest of unrimed and unvarnished advertising\\nefforts:\\nTry Blinker's Hair Renewer for the Hair.\\nIt scarcely seems possible that there was a time,\\nand not long ago, when such a mild, homely group\\nof words was thought to be advertising. Not so\\nto-dav. In these bustling times everything in\\ngeneral and advertising in particular must be spiced\\nand sugar-coated if designed to have the public\\nbite at it. And so the wide-awake framer of up\\nto-date advertising takes that same old theme,\\nonce so mildly treated, and brings it right ho ne\\nto us through the medium of poetry:\\nIf you'd have locks?long, lustrous, rich?\\nUse Blinker's flair Renewer, which\\nWill grow upon the baldest pate\\nHair by the bushel while you wait.\\nOur eyes have become so accustomed to seeing\\na number of lines of reading matter beginning with\\ncapital letters on the one hand and terminating\\nwith words of similar sound on the other that we\\nwould not pause to observe the simple request,\\n\\\"Use Blum's Stove Polish,\\\" which modest com\\nbination of words used to be deemed sufficiently\\nforceful and convincing to attract public notice.\\nTo-day the subject is set forth differently:\\nBlum's Polish makes the stove so bright\\nThe cook declares it blinds her sight\\nAnd so with every package we\\nPresent a pair of goggles free.\\nSo pronounced has become this desire to present\\nwhat were formerly considered purely commercial\\nthemes, in soft, sweet, rhythmic, rattling poetry,\\nthat in some of our more enlightened cities the street\\ncars are now recognized as being the people's true\\nliterary rendezvous. They are the centers?the\\nfive centers, so to speak?of the present day poetic\\nuplift. The whole commercial world, as it is at\\npresent represented in street-car literature, shows\\na growing disposition to lisp in numbers. Where\\nis this movement to stop? Is it ever going to stop?\\nCould we stop it if we would? Would we stop it if\\nwe could?\\nThe mind of man has ever been subservient to the\\npoetic spell. Poetry has always been recognized\\nas the helper and harmonizer of the race. High\\nthinkers of all ages have sought to say compliment\\nary things about it. It is in his poetry rather than\\nin his fine philosophical essays that Emerson is\\nto find his literary immortality. On the other\\nhand, Dickens is doomed to die because his writings\\nlack that poetic quality which, after all is said and\\ndone, is the true breath of literary life. This grave\\ndefect in Dickens is indicated in the words that pass\\nbetween the Wellers, father and son, as the latter\\nreads for the edification of the former the valentine\\nhe has just composed:\\n\\\" 'Tain't in poetry, is it?\\\" interposed the father.\\n\\\"No, no,\\\" replied Sam.\\n\\\" Wery glad to hear it,\\\" said Mr. Weller. \\\"Poetry's\\nunnat'ral. No man ever talked in poetry 'cept a\\nbeadle on boxin' day, or Warren's blackin' or\\nRowland's oil, or some o' them low fellows. Never\\nlot yourself down to talk poetry, my boy.\\\"\\nThen at the conclusion of the effort Sam says:\\n\\\"I could end it with a werse; what do you think?\\\"\\n\\\"I don't like it, Sam,\\\" rejoined Mr. Weller. \\\"I\\nnever know'd a respectable coachman as wrote\\npoetry 'cept one as made an affectin' copy o'\\nwerses the night afore he wos hung for a highway\\nrobbery, and he wos only a Cambervell man, so\\neven that's no rule.\\\"\\nBut the average man, no matter what his station\\nin life, has a touch of sentiment in him and more\\nor less of a fondness for poetry. He remembers\\nthat years ago it was his pleasure to read a poem\\nthat has lingered in his memory ever since. It\\ndescribed the flight of angels from Heaven to earth\\nand how they descended to this planet on a golden\\nladder. While they were viewing the beauty\\nof our earthly Paradise there suddenly appeared a\\nshadow across the land which caused a shudder to\\nsteal through their breasts. They hastened back\\nto the golden ladder to ascend once more to their\\nethereal realms. All were successful in reaching\\nthe ladder before it was withdrawn?all but two.\\nThose two have since been called the belated\\nangels, and the half-forgotten poem closes:\\nAnd those belated angels be\\nSweet Music and sweet Poetry.\\nIt is this hidden sentiment in the hearts of men\\nthat explains why they love poetry. They may\\ndeclare they do not like poetry, but they will read\\nstreet-car poetry. They've simply got to do so\\nunless they own a private carriage or automobile.\\nOne of the world's wise men has wisely told us:\\n\\\"Words are the only things that live forever.\\\"\\nA little couplet or quatrain is easily carried about\\nin the corner of one's mind to be breathed forth\\non any and every occasion. Not until some one\\nof a jingle-making turn of mind remarked that\\nEvening red and morning gray\\nAre sure to fetch a very fine day\\ndid a careless, unobserving world know that these\\ntwo meteorological conditions are the forerunners\\nof fine weather. As a matter of fact, it is probable\\nthat they were not so until this couplet was evolved,\\nsince when the weathi r has been made to conform\\nto the state of things as set forth in the lilting lines.\\nOne of our best-known college professors has\\nsaid: \\\"Whatever your occupation may be, and\\nhowever crowded your hours with affairs, do not\\nfail to secure at least a few minutes every day for\\nthe refreshment of your inner life with a bit of\\npoetry.\\\" As things used to be it was rather difficult\\nfor many of us to come into daily contact with\\npoetry. There were so many prosy duties keeping\\nus on the jump from the time the alarm clock awoke\\nus in the morning till late bedtime at night that\\npoetry was likely to be side-tracked for something\\nthat seemed to l>e of more immediate importance.\\nNow all is charmingly different.

W Kite\\n(In 1895)\\nA narrow rural road,\\nA wheelman a la mode,\\nA farmer who insists on driving straight;\\nAdjoining, banks of sand,\\nNo chance to pass him, and\\nThe cyclist bites the dust in humble state.\\n(In 1905)\\nSame highway once again,\\nSame farmer holds the rein.\\nSame wheelman speeds along*on air-shod steed:\\nFour wheels instead of two,\\nHis automobile new ?\\nThe tables turn?the rural czar is treed.\\nthere will come the moment when,\\ntired and indifferent as to what happens, we\\npermit the eye to find recreation wherever it\\nwill, and from that time forward the poet re\\nreading habit is fixed upon us. As Tennyson\\ntruly says:\\nNo rock so hard but that a little wave\\nMay beat admission in a thousand years.\\nFinally with everybody in the street-car reading\\npoetry, the next step is for them to reflect and\\nrepeat it in their daily walks or rides. Naturally\\nwe may expect the conductors who are about the\\ncars all the time to be the first to show in their\\nmode of speaking the effect of ;uch intimate asso\\nciation with so much poesy. Hence a student of\\nconditions as they exist to-day must not be sur\\nprised to he:ir a conductor say, in addressing a\\nwoman who by burying her face in a book is seeking\\nto convey the impression that she has been on the\\ncar ever since it started from away out in the open\\nlotted suburb:\\nPlease pardon me, but may I dare\\nTo ask you, lady, for your fare?\\nSome may think that this manner of speech is\\ntoo polite for a street-car conductor to employ,\\nbut let it be borne in mind that one of the chief\\nmissions of poetry is to promulgate politeness. A\\nmore general use of the former will insure a more\\nwidespread employment of the latter.\\nIn the winter time when the occupants of the\\nair-tight, non-ventilated, overcrowded car are\\nbreathing the so-called atmosphere it had in it\\nwhen it first left the barn at four-thirty that morn\\ning, some woman with weak lungs will summon up\\njust enough strength and courage to venture to\\nsay to the conductor:\\nDo you presume that it would rob\\nYou of your public-serving job\\nIf, just to save a life, you'd dare\\nAdmit a thimbleful of air?\\nAnd then that wise conductor, a man of years\\nand long suffering, will bend down close to the weak\\nwoman's ear and whisper:\\nI'd like to, lady, but you see\\nThat red-haired man there said to me\\nThat if I dared let in one jot\\nOf frosty air he'd have me shot.\\nIt isn't what we do that counts for so much in\\nthis world as it is the way in which we do it. Man\\nners are everything. The general employment of\\npoetry ought to work a great change for the better\\nin the street-car deportment of the public. It will\\ncertainly be lots nicer for all concerned when the\\nblunt remark; and the sarcastic retorts are re\\nplaced by s noothlv flowing, softly modulated\\ncouplets and quatrains. It is possible, even,\\nthat in the days to come when a conductor attempts\\nto collect a fare for carrying a youth nearly as large\\nas his mother the latter will be content to express\\nherself less crudely than she is likely to do at the\\npresent time:\\nHe's ridden nine years on this route,\\nAnd you're the first to say that he\\nIs more than five years old, you brute.\\nAnd I'll report you, sir! You'll see!\\nAnd then too there is a chance for a big reform\\nto be brought about in the manner in which the\\naverage man gets out of a seat and a woman gets\\ninto it. It is usually done in a bungling, unintelli\\ngent and unintelligible sort of way. But once the\\nstreet-car public becomes fully imbued with the\\nspirit of poesy which the present display of versified\\n\\\"ads\\\" seems certain to bring upon it we shall then\\nexpect a young man to know what to say and how\\nto say it:\\nPray. lady, have my seat, but not\\nBecause you look worn out or hot\\nOr ancient, for it is not so,\\nBut?here's where 1 get out. you know.\\nAnd the young woman?well, as a matter of\\ncourse, she will be thoroughly up with the advanced\\npoetic spirit of the times, as the women always are?\\nshe will say to the young man:\\nYou're very kind, I'm sure, and now\\nI'll show all true-born ladies how\\nTo act when \\\"He\\\" does aught for \\\"Her,\\\"\\nAnd so I shriek it Thank you, sir!\\nEven the cynic must admit that life will be\\nsweeter when the present little poetic street-car\\nadvertising leaven has finally made its influence\\nfelt throughout the whok lump.\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[37m\u001b[39;49;00m\n",

What is more,\\nthe most of us are so occupied and\\nconditioned that we are compelled to\\ntake a daily ride on a car and like\\nwise to read the aforesaid poetry\\nwhether we like it or not. We may\\nrefuse for a time to glance at it, but\\na chcerless, stupid cage in which an\\nunwilling, ill-natured public was carted from place\\nto place. Now it is fast becoming a veritable cir\\nculating library of poetry and art on wheels. The\\npopulace enters then in with the happy assurance\\nthat while there is small likelihood of its finding an\\nunoccupied seat, it is sure of meeting with many a\\nquaint and curious quatrain of poetic lore calculated\\nto make those who must cling to straps forget all\\ntheir woes and worries in contemplating the plea\\nsant food for thought so temptingly displayed on\\neverv hand.\\nWe've heard about those signs so plain that \\\"he who runs\\nmay read'':\\nBut when it comes to street-ear ads , why, there we do not\\nneed\\nTo run a bit, but idlv sit, al! active movements shunning,\\nAs by the mile we ride the while the car does all the\\nrunning.\\nWith what curious interest the street-car patron\\nhas watched the subtle but all-conquering advance\\nof poetry into the cold commercial world that\\nwas once deemed to be the undisputed realm of\\nplain prose.\\nTime was when poetry was est' erned to be too\\nfragile, too timid, too polite, to appear in mixed\\nassemblages. In those dear old delicate days it\\nwas honestly supposed that a full breath of real\\nbusiness atmosphere would prove almost fatal\\nto a tender triolet or a retiring rondo. But the\\ntimes change, and we are changed with them.\\nNowadays it is no unusual sight to see a sweet,\\nsentinental sonnet and a brisk, business-like sand\\nwich going hand in hand, as it were, about the busy\\nthoroughfares of our bustling cities.\\nTo illustrate the manner in which poetry is over\\ncoming prose, let us take, for example, a certain\\nwell-known brand of hair re newer which in the olden\\ndays when its name was first getting into placard\\ntype saw its virtues modestly hinted at in the\\nsimplest of unrimed and unvarnished advertising\\nefforts:\\nTry Blinker's Hair Renewer for the Hair.\\nIt scarcely seems possible that there was a time,\\nand not long ago, when such a mild, homely group\\nof words was thought to be advertising. Not so\\nto-dav. In these bustling times everything in\\ngeneral and advertising in particular must be spiced\\nand sugar-coated if designed to have the public\\nbite at it. And so the wide-awake framer of up\\nto-date advertising takes that same old theme,\\nonce so mildly treated, and brings it right ho ne\\nto us through the medium of poetry:\\nIf you'd have locks?long, lustrous, rich?\\nUse Blinker's flair Renewer, which\\nWill grow upon the baldest pate\\nHair by the bushel while you wait.\\nOur eyes have become so accustomed to seeing\\na number of lines of reading matter beginning with\\ncapital letters on the one hand and terminating\\nwith words of similar sound on the other that we\\nwould not pause to observe the simple request,\\n\\\"Use Blum's Stove Polish,\\\" which modest com\\nbination of words used to be deemed sufficiently\\nforceful and convincing to attract public notice.\\nTo-day the subject is set forth differently:\\nBlum's Polish makes the stove so bright\\nThe cook declares it blinds her sight\\nAnd so with every package we\\nPresent a pair of goggles free.\\nSo pronounced has become this desire to present\\nwhat were formerly considered purely commercial\\nthemes, in soft, sweet, rhythmic, rattling poetry,\\nthat in some of our more enlightened cities the street\\ncars are now recognized as being the people's true\\nliterary rendezvous. They are the centers?the\\nfive centers, so to speak?of the present day poetic\\nuplift. The whole commercial world, as it is at\\npresent represented in street-car literature, shows\\na growing disposition to lisp in numbers. Where\\nis this movement to stop? Is it ever going to stop?\\nCould we stop it if we would? Would we stop it if\\nwe could?\\nThe mind of man has ever been subservient to the\\npoetic spell. Poetry has always been recognized\\nas the helper and harmonizer of the race. High\\nthinkers of all ages have sought to say compliment\\nary things about it. It is in his poetry rather than\\nin his fine philosophical essays that Emerson is\\nto find his literary immortality. On the other\\nhand, Dickens is doomed to die because his writings\\nlack that poetic quality which, after all is said and\\ndone, is the true breath of literary life. This grave\\ndefect in Dickens is indicated in the words that pass\\nbetween the Wellers, father and son, as the latter\\nreads for the edification of the former the valentine\\nhe has just composed:\\n\\\" 'Tain't in poetry, is it?\\\" interposed the father.\\n\\\"No, no,\\\" replied Sam.\\n\\\" Wery glad to hear it,\\\" said Mr. Weller. \\\"Poetry's\\nunnat'ral. No man ever talked in poetry 'cept a\\nbeadle on boxin' day, or Warren's blackin' or\\nRowland's oil, or some o' them low fellows. Never\\nlot yourself down to talk poetry, my boy.\\\"\\nThen at the conclusion of the effort Sam says:\\n\\\"I could end it with a werse; what do you think?\\\"\\n\\\"I don't like it, Sam,\\\" rejoined Mr. Weller. \\\"I\\nnever know'd a respectable coachman as wrote\\npoetry 'cept one as made an affectin' copy o'\\nwerses the night afore he wos hung for a highway\\nrobbery, and he wos only a Cambervell man, so\\neven that's no rule.\\\"\\nBut the average man, no matter what his station\\nin life, has a touch of sentiment in him and more\\nor less of a fondness for poetry. He remembers\\nthat years ago it was his pleasure to read a poem\\nthat has lingered in his memory ever since. It\\ndescribed the flight of angels from Heaven to earth\\nand how they descended to this planet on a golden\\nladder. While they were viewing the beauty\\nof our earthly Paradise there suddenly appeared a\\nshadow across the land which caused a shudder to\\nsteal through their breasts. They hastened back\\nto the golden ladder to ascend once more to their\\nethereal realms. All were successful in reaching\\nthe ladder before it was withdrawn?all but two.\\nThose two have since been called the belated\\nangels, and the half-forgotten poem closes:\\nAnd those belated angels be\\nSweet Music and sweet Poetry.\\nIt is this hidden sentiment in the hearts of men\\nthat explains why they love poetry. They may\\ndeclare they do not like poetry, but they will read\\nstreet-car poetry. They've simply got to do so\\nunless they own a private carriage or automobile.\\nOne of the world's wise men has wisely told us:\\n\\\"Words are the only things that live forever.\\\"\\nA little couplet or quatrain is easily carried about\\nin the corner of one's mind to be breathed forth\\non any and every occasion. Not until some one\\nof a jingle-making turn of mind remarked that\\nEvening red and morning gray\\nAre sure to fetch a very fine day\\ndid a careless, unobserving world know that these\\ntwo meteorological conditions are the forerunners\\nof fine weather. As a matter of fact, it is probable\\nthat they were not so until this couplet was evolved,\\nsince when the weathi r has been made to conform\\nto the state of things as set forth in the lilting lines.\\nOne of our best-known college professors has\\nsaid: \\\"Whatever your occupation may be, and\\nhowever crowded your hours with affairs, do not\\nfail to secure at least a few minutes every day for\\nthe refreshment of your inner life with a bit of\\npoetry.\\\" As things used to be it was rather difficult\\nfor many of us to come into daily contact with\\npoetry. There were so many prosy duties keeping\\nus on the jump from the time the alarm clock awoke\\nus in the morning till late bedtime at night that\\npoetry was likely to be side-tracked for something\\nthat seemed to l>e of more immediate importance.\\nNow all is charmingly different.

W Kite\\n(In 1895)\\nA narrow rural road,\\nA wheelman a la mode,\\nA farmer who insists on driving straight;\\nAdjoining, banks of sand,\\nNo chance to pass him, and\\nThe cyclist bites the dust in humble state.\\n(In 1905)\\nSame highway once again,\\nSame farmer holds the rein.\\nSame wheelman speeds along*on air-shod steed:\\nFour wheels instead of two,\\nHis automobile new ?\\nThe tables turn?the rural czar is treed.\\nthere will come the moment when,\\ntired and indifferent as to what happens, we\\npermit the eye to find recreation wherever it\\nwill, and from that time forward the poet re\\nreading habit is fixed upon us. As Tennyson\\ntruly says:\\nNo rock so hard but that a little wave\\nMay beat admission in a thousand years.\\nFinally with everybody in the street-car reading\\npoetry, the next step is for them to reflect and\\nrepeat it in their daily walks or rides. Naturally\\nwe may expect the conductors who are about the\\ncars all the time to be the first to show in their\\nmode of speaking the effect of ;uch intimate asso\\nciation with so much poesy. Hence a student of\\nconditions as they exist to-day must not be sur\\nprised to he:ir a conductor say, in addressing a\\nwoman who by burying her face in a book is seeking\\nto convey the impression that she has been on the\\ncar ever since it started from away out in the open\\nlotted suburb:\\nPlease pardon me, but may I dare\\nTo ask you, lady, for your fare?\\nSome may think that this manner of speech is\\ntoo polite for a street-car conductor to employ,\\nbut let it be borne in mind that one of the chief\\nmissions of poetry is to promulgate politeness. A\\nmore general use of the former will insure a more\\nwidespread employment of the latter.\\nIn the winter time when the occupants of the\\nair-tight, non-ventilated, overcrowded car are\\nbreathing the so-called atmosphere it had in it\\nwhen it first left the barn at four-thirty that morn\\ning, some woman with weak lungs will summon up\\njust enough strength and courage to venture to\\nsay to the conductor:\\nDo you presume that it would rob\\nYou of your public-serving job\\nIf, just to save a life, you'd dare\\nAdmit a thimbleful of air?\\nAnd then that wise conductor, a man of years\\nand long suffering, will bend down close to the weak\\nwoman's ear and whisper:\\nI'd like to, lady, but you see\\nThat red-haired man there said to me\\nThat if I dared let in one jot\\nOf frosty air he'd have me shot.\\nIt isn't what we do that counts for so much in\\nthis world as it is the way in which we do it. Man\\nners are everything. The general employment of\\npoetry ought to work a great change for the better\\nin the street-car deportment of the public. It will\\ncertainly be lots nicer for all concerned when the\\nblunt remark; and the sarcastic retorts are re\\nplaced by s noothlv flowing, softly modulated\\ncouplets and quatrains. It is possible, even,\\nthat in the days to come when a conductor attempts\\nto collect a fare for carrying a youth nearly as large\\nas his mother the latter will be content to express\\nherself less crudely than she is likely to do at the\\npresent time:\\nHe's ridden nine years on this route,\\nAnd you're the first to say that he\\nIs more than five years old, you brute.\\nAnd I'll report you, sir! You'll see!\\nAnd then too there is a chance for a big reform\\nto be brought about in the manner in which the\\naverage man gets out of a seat and a woman gets\\ninto it. It is usually done in a bungling, unintelli\\ngent and unintelligible sort of way. But once the\\nstreet-car public becomes fully imbued with the\\nspirit of poesy which the present display of versified\\n\\\"ads\\\" seems certain to bring upon it we shall then\\nexpect a young man to know what to say and how\\nto say it:\\nPray. lady, have my seat, but not\\nBecause you look worn out or hot\\nOr ancient, for it is not so,\\nBut?here's where 1 get out. you know.\\nAnd the young woman?well, as a matter of\\ncourse, she will be thoroughly up with the advanced\\npoetic spirit of the times, as the women always are?\\nshe will say to the young man:\\nYou're very kind, I'm sure, and now\\nI'll show all true-born ladies how\\nTo act when \\\"He\\\" does aught for \\\"Her,\\\"\\nAnd so I shriek it Thank you, sir!\\nEven the cynic must admit that life will be\\nsweeter when the present little poetic street-car\\nadvertising leaven has finally made its influence\\nfelt throughout the whok lump.\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[37m\u001b[39;49;00m\n",

We may\\nrefuse for a time to glance at it, but\\na chcerless, stupid cage in which an\\nunwilling, ill-natured public was carted from place\\nto place. Now it is fast becoming a veritable cir\\nculating library of poetry and art on wheels. The\\npopulace enters then in with the happy assurance\\nthat while there is small likelihood of its finding an\\nunoccupied seat, it is sure of meeting with many a\\nquaint and curious quatrain of poetic lore calculated\\nto make those who must cling to straps forget all\\ntheir woes and worries in contemplating the plea\\nsant food for thought so temptingly displayed on\\neverv hand.\\nWe've heard about those signs so plain that \\\"he who runs\\nmay read'':\\nBut when it comes to street-ear ads , why, there we do not\\nneed\\nTo run a bit, but idlv sit, al! active movements shunning,\\nAs by the mile we ride the while the car does all the\\nrunning.\\nWith what curious interest the street-car patron\\nhas watched the subtle but all-conquering advance\\nof poetry into the cold commercial world that\\nwas once deemed to be the undisputed realm of\\nplain prose.\\nTime was when poetry was est' erned to be too\\nfragile, too timid, too polite, to appear in mixed\\nassemblages. In those dear old delicate days it\\nwas honestly supposed that a full breath of real\\nbusiness atmosphere would prove almost fatal\\nto a tender triolet or a retiring rondo. But the\\ntimes change, and we are changed with them.\\nNowadays it is no unusual sight to see a sweet,\\nsentinental sonnet and a brisk, business-like sand\\nwich going hand in hand, as it were, about the busy\\nthoroughfares of our bustling cities.\\nTo illustrate the manner in which poetry is over\\ncoming prose, let us take, for example, a certain\\nwell-known brand of hair re newer which in the olden\\ndays when its name was first getting into placard\\ntype saw its virtues modestly hinted at in the\\nsimplest of unrimed and unvarnished advertising\\nefforts:\\nTry Blinker's Hair Renewer for the Hair.\\nIt scarcely seems possible that there was a time,\\nand not long ago, when such a mild, homely group\\nof words was thought to be advertising. Not so\\nto-dav. In these bustling times everything in\\ngeneral and advertising in particular must be spiced\\nand sugar-coated if designed to have the public\\nbite at it. And so the wide-awake framer of up\\nto-date advertising takes that same old theme,\\nonce so mildly treated, and brings it right ho ne\\nto us through the medium of poetry:\\nIf you'd have locks?long, lustrous, rich?\\nUse Blinker's flair Renewer, which\\nWill grow upon the baldest pate\\nHair by the bushel while you wait.\\nOur eyes have become so accustomed to seeing\\na number of lines of reading matter beginning with\\ncapital letters on the one hand and terminating\\nwith words of similar sound on the other that we\\nwould not pause to observe the simple request,\\n\\\"Use Blum's Stove Polish,\\\" which modest com\\nbination of words used to be deemed sufficiently\\nforceful and convincing to attract public notice.\\nTo-day the subject is set forth differently:\\nBlum's Polish makes the stove so bright\\nThe cook declares it blinds her sight\\nAnd so with every package we\\nPresent a pair of goggles free.\\nSo pronounced has become this desire to present\\nwhat were formerly considered purely commercial\\nthemes, in soft, sweet, rhythmic, rattling poetry,\\nthat in some of our more enlightened cities the street\\ncars are now recognized as being the people's true\\nliterary rendezvous. They are the centers?the\\nfive centers, so to speak?of the present day poetic\\nuplift. The whole commercial world, as it is at\\npresent represented in street-car literature, shows\\na growing disposition to lisp in numbers. Where\\nis this movement to stop? Is it ever going to stop?\\nCould we stop it if we would? Would we stop it if\\nwe could?\\nThe mind of man has ever been subservient to the\\npoetic spell. Poetry has always been recognized\\nas the helper and harmonizer of the race. High\\nthinkers of all ages have sought to say compliment\\nary things about it. It is in his poetry rather than\\nin his fine philosophical essays that Emerson is\\nto find his literary immortality. On the other\\nhand, Dickens is doomed to die because his writings\\nlack that poetic quality which, after all is said and\\ndone, is the true breath of literary life. This grave\\ndefect in Dickens is indicated in the words that pass\\nbetween the Wellers, father and son, as the latter\\nreads for the edification of the former the valentine\\nhe has just composed:\\n\\\" 'Tain't in poetry, is it?\\\" interposed the father.\\n\\\"No, no,\\\" replied Sam.\\n\\\" Wery glad to hear it,\\\" said Mr. Weller. \\\"Poetry's\\nunnat'ral. No man ever talked in poetry 'cept a\\nbeadle on boxin' day, or Warren's blackin' or\\nRowland's oil, or some o' them low fellows. Never\\nlot yourself down to talk poetry, my boy.\\\"\\nThen at the conclusion of the effort Sam says:\\n\\\"I could end it with a werse; what do you think?\\\"\\n\\\"I don't like it, Sam,\\\" rejoined Mr. Weller. \\\"I\\nnever know'd a respectable coachman as wrote\\npoetry 'cept one as made an affectin' copy o'\\nwerses the night afore he wos hung for a highway\\nrobbery, and he wos only a Cambervell man, so\\neven that's no rule.\\\"\\nBut the average man, no matter what his station\\nin life, has a touch of sentiment in him and more\\nor less of a fondness for poetry. He remembers\\nthat years ago it was his pleasure to read a poem\\nthat has lingered in his memory ever since. It\\ndescribed the flight of angels from Heaven to earth\\nand how they descended to this planet on a golden\\nladder. While they were viewing the beauty\\nof our earthly Paradise there suddenly appeared a\\nshadow across the land which caused a shudder to\\nsteal through their breasts. They hastened back\\nto the golden ladder to ascend once more to their\\nethereal realms. All were successful in reaching\\nthe ladder before it was withdrawn?all but two.\\nThose two have since been called the belated\\nangels, and the half-forgotten poem closes:\\nAnd those belated angels be\\nSweet Music and sweet Poetry.\\nIt is this hidden sentiment in the hearts of men\\nthat explains why they love poetry. They may\\ndeclare they do not like poetry, but they will read\\nstreet-car poetry. They've simply got to do so\\nunless they own a private carriage or automobile.\\nOne of the world's wise men has wisely told us:\\n\\\"Words are the only things that live forever.\\\"\\nA little couplet or quatrain is easily carried about\\nin the corner of one's mind to be breathed forth\\non any and every occasion. Not until some one\\nof a jingle-making turn of mind remarked that\\nEvening red and morning gray\\nAre sure to fetch a very fine day\\ndid a careless, unobserving world know that these\\ntwo meteorological conditions are the forerunners\\nof fine weather. As a matter of fact, it is probable\\nthat they were not so until this couplet was evolved,\\nsince when the weathi r has been made to conform\\nto the state of things as set forth in the lilting lines.\\nOne of our best-known college professors has\\nsaid: \\\"Whatever your occupation may be, and\\nhowever crowded your hours with affairs, do not\\nfail to secure at least a few minutes every day for\\nthe refreshment of your inner life with a bit of\\npoetry.\\\" As things used to be it was rather difficult\\nfor many of us to come into daily contact with\\npoetry. There were so many prosy duties keeping\\nus on the jump from the time the alarm clock awoke\\nus in the morning till late bedtime at night that\\npoetry was likely to be side-tracked for something\\nthat seemed to l>e of more immediate importance.\\nNow all is charmingly different. For five cents\\nof ttlhe Road\\nBy Morris J. W Kite\\n(In 1895)\\nA narrow rural road,\\nA wheelman a la mode,\\nA farmer who insists on driving straight;\\nAdjoining, banks of sand,\\nNo chance to pass him, and\\nThe cyclist bites the dust in humble state.\\n(In 1905)\\nSame highway once again,\\nSame farmer holds the rein.\\nSame wheelman speeds along*on air-shod steed:\\nFour wheels instead of two,\\nHis automobile new ?\\nThe tables turn?the rural czar is treed.\\nthere will come the moment when,\\ntired and indifferent as to what happens, we\\npermit the eye to find recreation wherever it\\nwill, and from that time forward the poet re\\nreading habit is fixed upon us. As Tennyson\\ntruly says:\\nNo rock so hard but that a little wave\\nMay beat admission in a thousand years.\\nFinally with everybody in the street-car reading\\npoetry, the next step is for them to reflect and\\nrepeat it in their daily walks or rides. Naturally\\nwe may expect the conductors who are about the\\ncars all the time to be the first to show in their\\nmode of speaking the effect of ;uch intimate asso\\nciation with so much poesy. Hence a student of\\nconditions as they exist to-day must not be sur\\nprised to he:ir a conductor say, in addressing a\\nwoman who by burying her face in a book is seeking\\nto convey the impression that she has been on the\\ncar ever since it started from away out in the open\\nlotted suburb:\\nPlease pardon me, but may I dare\\nTo ask you, lady, for your fare?\\nSome may think that this manner of speech is\\ntoo polite for a street-car conductor to employ,\\nbut let it be borne in mind that one of the chief\\nmissions of poetry is to promulgate politeness. A\\nmore general use of the former will insure a more\\nwidespread employment of the latter.\\nIn the winter time when the occupants of the\\nair-tight, non-ventilated, overcrowded car are\\nbreathing the so-called atmosphere it had in it\\nwhen it first left the barn at four-thirty that morn\\ning, some woman with weak lungs will summon up\\njust enough strength and courage to venture to\\nsay to the conductor:\\nDo you presume that it would rob\\nYou of your public-serving job\\nIf, just to save a life, you'd dare\\nAdmit a thimbleful of air?\\nAnd then that wise conductor, a man of years\\nand long suffering, will bend down close to the weak\\nwoman's ear and whisper:\\nI'd like to, lady, but you see\\nThat red-haired man there said to me\\nThat if I dared let in one jot\\nOf frosty air he'd have me shot.\\nIt isn't what we do that counts for so much in\\nthis world as it is the way in which we do it. Man\\nners are everything. The general employment of\\npoetry ought to work a great change for the better\\nin the street-car deportment of the public. It will\\ncertainly be lots nicer for all concerned when the\\nblunt remark; and the sarcastic retorts are re\\nplaced by s noothlv flowing, softly modulated\\ncouplets and quatrains. It is possible, even,\\nthat in the days to come when a conductor attempts\\nto collect a fare for carrying a youth nearly as large\\nas his mother the latter will be content to express\\nherself less crudely than she is likely to do at the\\npresent time:\\nHe's ridden nine years on this route,\\nAnd you're the first to say that he\\nIs more than five years old, you brute.\\nAnd I'll report you, sir! You'll see!\\nAnd then too there is a chance for a big reform\\nto be brought about in the manner in which the\\naverage man gets out of a seat and a woman gets\\ninto it. It is usually done in a bungling, unintelli\\ngent and unintelligible sort of way. But once the\\nstreet-car public becomes fully imbued with the\\nspirit of poesy which the present display of versified\\n\\\"ads\\\" seems certain to bring upon it we shall then\\nexpect a young man to know what to say and how\\nto say it:\\nPray. lady, have my seat, but not\\nBecause you look worn out or hot\\nOr ancient, for it is not so,\\nBut?here's where 1 get out. you know.\\nAnd the young woman?well, as a matter of\\ncourse, she will be thoroughly up with the advanced\\npoetic spirit of the times, as the women always are?\\nshe will say to the young man:\\nYou're very kind, I'm sure, and now\\nI'll show all true-born ladies how\\nTo act when \\\"He\\\" does aught for \\\"Her,\\\"\\nAnd so I shriek it Thank you, sir!\\nEven the cynic must admit that life will be\\nsweeter when the present little poetic street-car\\nadvertising leaven has finally made its influence\\nfelt throughout the whok lump.\"\u001b[39;49;00m,\u001b[37m\u001b[39;49;00m\n",

Poems are more easy to re\\nmember than prose because of their\\nrhyme. In prose we have things told\\njust as though we were talking to each\\nother. Prose is used to tell almost any\\nkind of a story or to describe anything.\\nThere are beautiful scenes in the world,\\ngrand things in history and noble\\nthoughts that can be much better de\\nscribed in poetry.\\nWhen our far-off forefathers could\\nrot even read or write they had poets\\n\\u2022who went with them into battle and\\nafter the victory these poets or 'bards'\\nas they were called would compose\\nverses of fine-sounding words to cele\\nbrate the victory. These verses were\\nsung while they played the harp. Per\\nhaps in this way poetry began and\\nmen found they could best utter their\\nhappiness by choosing words of a\\nmusical sound.\\nThere are three kinds of poetry.\\n\\u2022Dramatic poetry is written in the form\\nof people speaking to each other as in\\nthe plays of Shakespeare. Then we\\nhave epic poetry which is usually a\\ndescription of some great event, or\\n.hero, or the history of a nation. The\\nthird is called lyric poetry because it\\n\\u2022was originally intended to be sung to\\nthe playing of the lyre. All beautiful\\nsongs fall in the lyric class of poetry.\\nWe know poems sometimes rhyme\\nand sometimes they do not.

PERRO\\nState Poetry Chairman\\nPOETRY DAY was first started in\\nOhio in 1937 by Tessa Sweazy Webb but\\nthere was no definite date set. Later\\nLucia Trent of Texas spearheaded a\\nmovement for one day to be set for ail\\nstates and the late Governor Jester of\\nTexas set Oct. 15 by proclamation.\\nIt took many years of hard work by\\nthe different state chairmen before all\\nof the states held Poetry Day but last\\nyear it was a nation-wide affair and it\\nwill be again this year.\\nMany foreign countries are also ob\\nserving Oct. 15 as their Poetry Day\\nand joining with the U.S. in honoring\\nthe poets of the past as well as the\\npresent.\\nEach Poetry Day the chairmen try\\nto use as much of the poetry from their\\nown state's authors as possible. Radio,\\nnewspapers, magazines and clubs are\\nvery helpful in giving to the public the\\npoems of their own state authors. It\\nis encouraging to see the upward trend\\nin the creative ability of the younger\\ngeneration.\\nSchools study the writers of olden\\ntimes, of other states and of their own\\nand pupils are encouraged to write and\\nsend in compositions of their own to\\ntheir state poetry magazine. In Mon\\ntana that magazine is known as\\nthe Montana Poetry Quarterly. It has\\nbeen in circulation for 11 years and is\\nan amateur journal to help the begin\\nner although it carries work from\\nworld-wide sources and from world\\nknown authors.\\nMontana held its first Poetry Day in\\n1950 and has had a fine program put\\non by its workers each year since then.\\nThe state is divided into districts and\\neach district has its own chairman.\\nThese workers are standing ready to\\nhelp the new author at any time.\\nIt is never too early to send poems\\nto the state chairman for judging for\\nthe next Poetry Day program. These\\npoems should be sent to Jessie L. Per\\nro, Seeley Lake, Mont. She will either\\ndirect you to the chairman in your dis\\ntrict or will handle the poetry herself.\\nOur writers are gaining wide recogni\\ntion in the last few years.\\nAs our governor proclamation states,\\nwe do have a very wonderful state in\\nwhich to write and a wonderful store\\nroom from which to gain a subject.\\nWhat could be more colorful and soul\\nstirring than the countryside today?\\nIf inspiration is what you need just look\\nand I am sure that you will find\\ninspiration than you will find energy\\nto use!\\nSo, as we celebrate another great\\nMontana Poetry Day, you poets give\\npen to those poems which you feel in\\nyour heart and which others would en\\njoy reading.\\nmore\\nO may I never envy thee\\nThe things that were not meant for\\nMay I have strength to quench the fire\\nThat kindles hot with my desire;\\nAnd may I ever be content\\nWith my own lot, be it in tent\\nOr stately mansion\\u2014my heart at peace\\nWith all the world 'til my time\\n\\u2014Mrs. Arthur Roat, Lake County.\\nme;\\ncease.\\nyjeedieivorlz\\n3 INCH\\nI doll\\no\\n2141\\nr &\\nA\\nW\\n/;\\na\\niL\\nV*.\\n'\\u2022A\\nV.\\n\\\\\\n, / }\\nA J\\n2141\\u2014Here is a cute 32-inch little miss\\nthat will be the \\\"pride and joy\\\" of your\\nlittle lady.\\njgsssn\\nwmmm ^\\n\\u00eejjti 1'*;'!!\\u2022'\\niutja\\nr\\n*\\nmm\\n\\u00bb!* /\\u00bbV \\u00bb '\\nSi*\\u00ab\\u00ab\\nCl fl\\n5469\\u2014 Crocheted doilies \\u2014 each measur\\ning 8\\\" in diameter.
