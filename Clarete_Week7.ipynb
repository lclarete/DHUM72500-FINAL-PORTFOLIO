When you are actually doing your own text analysis project, you will have a much messier process. During this week's reading, you will have read several pieces about what cleaning takes place and some of the challenges that data presents when working with text. In particular, we're looking at text analysis from a humanities / litereary perspective; however, one might argue that these challenges are more similar to the text analysis one might perform in the social sciences or with non-fiction work than might appear to be the case on the surface. \n",

However, we can also use another module from the URLLIB package that is designed to import an .html file directly from the web. We can actually do this with just a few lines of code. First, we import the URLLIB package, and specifically the `request` module. We assign the URL we want to manipulate by assigning the URL to a variable. Next, we pass the URL through the urlopen.request function from the URLLIB package, and also at the same time \"read\" the file. The output of that string becomes the variable `html`. When we print the variable html, we discover that all of the HTML from the page has been pulled into the variable name. Unfortuantely, it doesn't look very clean. "

        "In order to perform a text analysis based on a webpage data (HTML tags), we have to web scraping the page. Some of the Python libraries that can be used are including Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Requests-HTML. For example, using the Beautiful Soup library, you can extract the text content of a webpage as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "import requests\n",
        "from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n",
        "\n",
        "# Send a GET request to the webpage\n",
        "response = requests.get('https://www.example.com')\n",
        "\n",
        "# Parse the HTML content using Beautiful Soup\n",
        "soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n",

        "text = soup.get_text()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `requests.get()` function sends a GET request to the specified webpage and returns the HTML content of the page as a response object. The response object's content attribute contains the HTML content of the page.\n",
        "\n",
        "The HTML content is then parsed using the Beautiful Soup library's `BeautifulSoup()` function, which returns a BeautifulSoup object that can be used to extract the text content of the page. The `soup.get_text()` function extracts the text content of the page and discards the HTML tags.\n",
        "\n",
        "When extracting text from a webpage, it's important to consider what data should be preserved or discarded. Typically, you would want to preserve the text content of the webpage while discarding any irrelevant or extraneous information, such as HTML tags, scripts, and stylesheets. However, the specific data that should be preserved or discarded will depend on the goals of the text analysis and the structure of the webpage.\n",

It method involves parsing the HTML code of a webpage to extract the desired content. It is a more targeted approach  to extract only the specific elements of the webpage that you are interested in. This method requires the use of a third-party library, such as BeautifulSoup, and some knowledge of HTML structure and syntax.\n",
